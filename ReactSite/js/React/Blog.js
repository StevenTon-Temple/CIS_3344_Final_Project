            <h3>HW 07</h3>
            <p>
                I thought the HW wasn't too bad I actually understood it a lot more than I thought I did.
                I took me around 2 hours to finish this Homework.
                I think the hardest part for me was trying to stay focused I kept going on ahead to finish thing ahead before I finshed what I was currently working on.
                Easiest part was just reading the code and knowing how to change it to fit my requirement but also was hardest for me as well because of what I said above.
                In all it wasn't a bad Homework assignment.
